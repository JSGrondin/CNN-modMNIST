# CNN-modMNIST
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

This mini-project was undertaken as part of COMP-551 at McGill University. 

The goal of this project was to develop machine learning methods for identifying and classifying the biggest digits from a modified MNIST dataset. A simple KNN classifier was implemented as a baseline. Different CNN architectures were investigated in order to get the best possible results. 

The following files were used: 

data_extraction.py : to load all 64x64 greyscale images

extract_digit.py : to extract the digit that occupies the largest space in the original image

KNN.py : baseline model

CNN_main : final CNN architecture used
